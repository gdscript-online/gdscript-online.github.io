# GDScript Online

An online GDScript runtime environment. The main use case is to play around
with GDScript without needing to install Godot. This can be useful when
you're using a PC on which you can't run executables downloaded from the Web.

## Limitations

This is only a minimal script editor for quick testing purposes.
It aims to start up quickly and require few resources.

If you're looking for the full Godot editor running in your browser,
use the official [Godot Engine Web Editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/).
